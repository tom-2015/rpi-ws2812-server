# General commands
Here is a list of commands you can type or send to the program. All commands have optional comma seperated parameters. The parameters must be in the correct order!

* `init` command must be called everytime the program is started after the setup command, this will initialize resource on the Pi according to the setup command

```
init <frequency>,<dma>

# <frequency> Frequency to use for communication to the LEDs, default 800000
# <dma>       DMA channel number to use, default 10 be careful not to use any channels in use by the system as this may crash your SD card/OS
#             use cat /proc/device-tree/soc/dma@7e007000/brcm,dma-channel-mask to see which channels (bitmask) might be used by the OS
```

* `setup` command must be called everytime the program is started:

Depending on the `<led_type>` the setup command takes different parameters.

```

# For <led_type> values 0-11 (WS2812 and SK6812 chips):

setup <channel>,<led_count>,<led_type>,<invert>,<global_brightness>,<gpionum>

# <channel>            Channel number
# <led_count>          Number of leds in channel
# <led_type>           Type of led (3 color or 4 color) default 0
# <invert>             Invert output, default 0
# <global_brightness>  Global brightness level for channel (0-255), default 255
# <gpionum>            GPIO output number, default 18 for more see 'GPIO usage' at this page: https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x


# For <led_type> values 12-17 (SK9822 chips):

setup <channel>,<led_count>,<led_type>,<invert>,<global_brightness>,<SPI_DEV>,<SPI_SPEED>,<ALT_SPI_PIN>

# <channel>            Channel number
# <led_count>          Number of leds in channel

99 VIRTUAL LED CHANNEL
100 Slave channel, forward data to another slave connected Raspberry

When using led_type = 99 this function takes different arguments:
setup <channel>,<led_count>, 99, <parent_channel_number>, <offset>

# <channel>            		Channel number to initialize
# <led_count>		   		Number of leds in the virtual channel
# 99				   		Virtual channel LED type
# <parent_channel_number>	The phyisical channel number previously initialized with the setup command
# <offset>					Start at this LED position in the phyisical LED string

# When using LED type = 99 you can create a virtual LED channel which is a part of a physical LED channel previously setup with one of the other LED types. This enables you to connect all your LEDs together and use the effect commands as if they were connected as sperated strings.

When using led_type = 100 this function takes different arguments:
setup <channel>,<led_count>, 100, <Host/IP>, <port>, <color_count>

# <channel>            		Channel number to initialize
# <led_count>		   		Number of leds in the virtual channel

# <Host/IP>	                The name or IP of the slave connected Raspberry Pi
# <port>					Port the slave is listening on (TCP)
# <color_count>             In case the slave has connected the SK6812 chip, color count must be 4 else use default 3.

# When using LED type = 100 you can create a channel that will render on a slave Raspberry Pi. All color data is transmitted in TCP packets over the network everytime you call the render function. On the remote slave Pi run the command slave_listen to listen for incoming data.

```

# Audio commands

* `record_audio` records audio

```
record_audio <device>,<sample_rate>,<sample_count>,<channels>

# <device>			Audio device, use arecord -L to list device and use the "plughw:*" device.
# <sample_rate>		Here you can change the number of samples per second, default is 24000. Higher will require more CPU but better results with high frequency.
# <channels>		Number of audio channels, default is 2 (stereo)
# <sample_count>	Number of samples to store in the internal buffer before forwarding to DSP. Default is 1024 and you better leave it like that.
# <gain>            Multiply samples with this value (float), may slow down the Pi.
```

Use device name thread://<thread_id> to get samples captured in another thread (see examples/stream_audio_multiple_threads.htm).

Since version 6.2 you can use udp port or named pipe as audio input device.
For example: udp://9000 as device will listen on local port 9000. External program can then send raw audio samples to this port.
Audio samples can also be broadcasted on the network to multiple Pis when using udpb://9000 it will listen to broadcast port 9000.
Example: arecord and socat can be used for this (also possible on a remote device by changing the destination ip 127.0.0.1):
```
arecord -f FLOAT_LE -r 24000 -c 2 - | socat -b 1024 - udp-datagram:127.0.0.1:6000,broadcast
```

Another option is to create a local named pipe with pipe:///dev/audio_input this will create a file where you can send audio samples to.
For example with arecord:
```
arecord -D "plughw:CARD=Capture,DEV=0" -V stereo -f FLOAT_LE -r 24000 -c 2 - > /dev/audio_input
```
