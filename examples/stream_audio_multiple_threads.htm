		<title>WS2812 Server - recording audio to multiple threads</title>
	</head>
<body>

<p>
You can use one thread to record audio and stream it to other threads, each of these threads can be connected to a LED string that runs a different effect like light organ, pulses, etc...
<br/>
In this example the main thread will only be used to record/capture audio from the sound card. The main thread will feed the samples to thread 1 and thread 2.<br/>
Thread 1 and 2 will apply a different filter and different effect.
<div class="commands">
