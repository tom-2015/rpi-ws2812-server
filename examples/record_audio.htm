<p>
You'll need a USB sound interface to record audio or HDMI capture device to capture audio from another Raspberry or computer.
ALSA must be installed as sound system for your Raspberry (but this is installed by default).

Now you need to list the available audio record devices with:
<div class="commands">
<code>
arecord -L
</code>
</div>

It will list all available audio devices, search for the line that begins with "plughw". For example: plughw:CARD=Device,DEV=0 this is the device name we need to initialize recording.<br/>
Then you can start recording audio with these commands for example a 120 led string:
</p>

<div class="commands">
<code>
setup 1,120,3
init
record_audio "plughw:CARD=Device,DEV=0"
</code>
</div>

<P>
Now audio will be recorded in internal buffer and you can start using audio effect commands.<br/>
</P>

Example:

<div class="commands">
<code>
setup 1,50,3,0,255,18
init
record_audio "plughw:CARD=Capture,DEV=0",48000,2
filter_audio 1,100
do
	light_organ 1,2,,10,60,,,,,10
	vu_meter 1,,,60
	pulses 1,0.02,2,,,10,,60
loop
</code>
</div>

<p>
	With the filter_audio command you can apply a simple low pass, high pass or band pass filter.
</p>

-The recording is thread dependend, if you want to create a second thread you'll also need to start a record command in that thread first. But you can forward recorded samples to <a href="stream_audio_multiple_threads.htm">other threads</a>. <br/>
-If you get error "Cannot set parameters (Invalid argument)." this mostly means that the audio device doesn't support the requested sample rate. Try to launch the record command with different sample rate like: <br/>
<div class="commands">
<code>
record_audio "plughw:CARD=Capture,DEV=0",48000,2
</code>
</div>
</p>
