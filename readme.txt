#Rpi-ws2812-server
This is a small program for driving the WS281x (a.k.a. [NeoPixel](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12999)) LEDs from a webserver, command line, text file, Python,... using the Raspberry Pi.
It uses the rpi_ws281x PWM driver code from jgarff ([https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)). 
The LEDs can be controlled by sending text commands to a tcp socket. These commands can be generated by a webserver script, android app,... 
It's also possible to control the leds directly from the command line or by loading text file containing some predefined color patterns.

!!!!!
On newer Raspbian (Jessie) operating system the audio output is activated by default, you need to disable this:
You can do this by blacklisting the sound module:
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf

blacklist snd_bcm2835

also in /boot/config.txt you comment out the audio=on parameter:

# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
#dtparam=audio=on
!!!!!

#Installation
On the raspberry you open a terminal window and type following commands:
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install gcc make git
* git clone https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server.git
* cd rpi-ws2812-server
* make
* sudo chmod +x ws2812svr

#Testing
Hook up your LEDs to the PWM output of the Raspberry Pi.
sudo ./ws2812svr
#first initialize the driver code from jgarff.
#on the following line you must **replace 10** by the number of leds you have attached!

setup 1,10
init

#now you can type commands to change the color of the leds
#For example make them all red:

fill 1,FF0000

#now send the color buffer to the leds:
render

#Supported commands
Here is a list of commands you can type or send to the program. All commands have optional comma seperated parameters. The parameters must be in the correct order!

*Setup command must be called everytime the program is started:
    setup 
		<channel>, 						#channel number
		<led_count>, 					#number of leds in channel
		<led_type>, 					#type of led (3 color or 4 color) default 0
		<invert>, 						#invert output, default 0
		<global_brightness>, 			#global brightness level for channel (0-255), default 255
		<gpionum>						#GPIO output number, 18 for PWM0 = pin 12
			Possible values for gpionum:
			-PWM:
				PWM0, which can be set to use GPIOs 12, 18, 40, and 52.
				Only 12 (pin 32) and 18 (pin 12) are available on the B+/2B/3B
				PWM1 which can be set to use GPIOs 13, 19, 41, 45 and 53.
				Only 13 is available on the B+/2B/PiZero/3B, on pin 33

			-PCM:
				PCM_DOUT, which can be set to use GPIOs 21 and 31.
				Only 21 is available on the B+/2B/PiZero/3B, on pin 40.

			-SPI:
				SPI0-MOSI is available on GPIOs 10 and 38.
				Only GPIO 10 is available on all models.

#Special keywords
You can add 'do ... loop' to repeat commands when using a file or TCP connection.

For example the commands between do and loop will be executed 10 times:
do
   <enter commands here to repeat>
loop 10
(Endless loops can be made by removing the '10')

For 'do loop' to work from a TCP connection we must start a new thread. 
This thread will continue to execute the commands when the client disconnects from the TCP/IP connection. 
The thread will automatically stop executing the next time the client reconnects (ideal for webservers).

For example:
thread_start
   do
      rotate 1,1,2
      render
      delay 200
   loop
thread_stop
<client must close connection now>

#PHP example

First start the server program:

sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp

Then run the php code from the webserver:

//create a rainbow for 10 leds on channel 1:
send_to_leds("setup channel_1_count=10;rainbow;brightness 1,32;");
function send_to_leds ($data){
    $sock = fsockopen("127.0.0.1", 9999);
    fwrite($sock, $data);
    fclose($sock);
}

#Command line parameters
* sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp 9999  
  Listens for clients to connect to port 9999 (default)
* sudo ./ws2812svr -f text_file.txt  
  Loads commands from text_file.txt
* sudo ./ws2812svr -p /dev/ws281x  
  Creates a file called `/dev/ws281x` where you can write you commands to with any other programming language (do-loop not supported here).
* sudo ./ws2812svr -i "setup 1,4,5;init;"
  Initializes with command setup 1,4,5  and command init
